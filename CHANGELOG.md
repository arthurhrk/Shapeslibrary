## [1.2.2] - 2025-01-31

### Removed
- **"Save Native Now" action**: Removed as problematic and redundant
  - Action generated native PPTX using `pptxgenjs` (synthetic generation)
  - Would apply Office default theme instead of configured custom template
  - Defeated the purpose of template-based color/font fidelity (v1.2.0)
  - All shapes now automatically get native PPTX during capture with correct template
  - No longer needed - recapturing shapes is the correct way to regenerate native files

### Changed
- Updated error messages to guide users to recapture shapes instead of using removed action
- Cleaner action panel with only essential utilities

## [1.2.1] - 2025-01-31
